# v1.7.1 beta testing

PR #91 remains unmerged. Package/release metadata targets **v1.7.1-beta.1** with
`prerelease=true`. It is intended for real Home Assistant/HACS owner testing,
not stable v1.7.1 approval. See [beta publishing](BETA_RELEASES.md) for the
branch-independent, explicitly authorized publication workflow.

## HACS installation after publication

1. Back up dashboard YAML. In HACS, open Honeycomb Menu NG, choose **Redownload**
   from its menu, enable **Show beta versions**, and select **v1.7.1-beta.1**.
   If needed first add `NicolaiTandrup/honeycomb-menu-ng` as a Dashboard repository.
2. Confirm that the selected version is the beta, download it, then hard-refresh
   dashboard clients/clear frontend cache. Keep the existing JavaScript module
   resource; the asset remains `honeycomb-menu-ng.js`.
3. Verify slots: 1 Radio, 2 Play/Pause, 3 Solo/Join, 4 Browse, 5 Down, 6 Up.
4. Check favorite order/playback/logos, new ring colors and Join/unjoin via the
   configured script. Confirm current HA favorite IDs/URIs/cache metadata before
   expecting launcher recognition. Unknown metadata must fall back safely.
5. Play, pause, stop and change stations, then test grouped playback. Paused/stopped
   center must be neutral; failed/missing logos must restore the standard icon.
   Check explicit styles and center/back navigation.
6. Review README layout on desktop/mobile in light/dark GitHub themes.

Return the installed beta version, observed HA state and result using synthetic
identifiers in public reports. Defects get new beta.2/beta.3 tags, never moved tags.
The default cache recipe lacks playback URIs; exact favorite IDs or a unique URI
already supplied in external cache metadata are required for launcher recognition.
There is no fuzzy title matching. Color assignment is stable across reordering
of the same favorite set; changing the set can reassign colliding palette entries.

Every future version must ship an installable prerelease and receive explicit
owner confirmation from real HA testing before merge/promotion or stable
publication. PR #91 cannot merge and v1.7.1 cannot publish stable until that
approval. Stable releases, retention settings, existing tags, branches and history
are not changed by beta publication.
