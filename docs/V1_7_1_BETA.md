# v1.7.1 beta testing

PR #91 and Light PR #94 remain unmerged. Integration metadata targets **v1.7.1-beta.3** with
`prerelease=true`. It is intended for real Home Assistant/HACS owner testing,
not stable v1.7.1 approval. See [beta publishing](BETA_RELEASES.md) for the
branch-independent, explicitly authorized publication workflow.

## HACS installation after publication

1. Back up dashboard YAML. In HACS, open Honeycomb Menu NG, choose **Redownload**
   from its menu, enable **Show beta versions**, and select **v1.7.1-beta.3**.
   If needed first add `NicolaiTandrup/honeycomb-menu-ng` as a Dashboard repository.
2. Confirm that the selected version is the beta, download it, then hard-refresh
   dashboard clients/clear frontend cache. Keep the existing JavaScript module
   resource; the asset remains `honeycomb-menu-ng.js`.
3. Verify slots: 1 Radio, 2 Play/Pause, 3 Solo/Join, 4 Browse, 5 Down, 6 Up.
4. Check favorite order/playback/logos, new ring colors and Join/unjoin via the
   configured script. Confirm current HA favorite IDs/URIs/cache metadata before
   expecting launcher recognition. Unknown metadata must fall back safely.
5. Play, pause, stop and change stations, then test grouped playback. Paused/stopped
   center must be neutral; failed/missing logos must restore the standard icon.
   Check explicit styles and center/back navigation.
6. Review README layout on desktop/mobile in light/dark GitHub themes.

Return the installed beta version, observed HA state and result using synthetic
identifiers in public reports. Beta.1 and beta.2 remain immutable. Beta.3 cumulatively contains all tested
Sonos beta.2 fixes plus Light Color Zoom from independent PR #94. Never move tags.
For Light: open Color; short tap applies once; hold 500 ms refines without changing
the light. Verify slots 7/8/10/18, several zoom levels, exact stepwise back, live
state updates, full close/reopen reset, Shift+Enter zoom and Escape close. White/
Kelvin and presets remain unchanged. See [the exact grid](LIGHT_MODULE.md#recursive-color-zoom-issue-85-beta3).

Beta.2 also recognizes unique exact radio-channel/favorite/cache-title correspondence
for validated Sonos radio transports. Media titles and fuzzy matching are excluded.
Join discovers real Sonos registry entries; native grouping needs supported
features/services. Browse opens the selected player in the HA Media panel. Color assignment is stable across reordering
of the same favorite set; changing the set can reassign colliding palette entries.

Every future version must ship an installable prerelease and receive explicit
owner confirmation from real HA testing before merge/promotion or stable
publication. PR #91 cannot merge and v1.7.1 cannot publish stable until that
approval. Stable releases, retention settings, existing tags, branches and history
are not changed by beta publication.
